    EXAM TOOL
I'm tired with multiple choices questions so i created this


1. How It Works
  - Input: You enter the question in the top box, and the answers in the bottom box (the first line is the correct answer by default).

  - Storage: Data is securely stored in the database_exam.json file for reuse at any time.

  - Execution: At the start, the application uses a random library to shuffle the data and activate a timer.

  - Result: The system compares your choice with the original answer to grade it.

2. Quick Start
Run the build_app.bat file to automatically package it into a single .exe file in the dist folder.
